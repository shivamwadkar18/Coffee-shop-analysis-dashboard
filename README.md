# Coffee-shop-analysis-dashboard
In this project, I harnessed the full power of Power BI, SQL, and DAX to transform raw data into insightful visualizations. This dashboard elegantly showcases coffee shop sales trends by calendar dates, months, and individual product values, providing a clear and comprehensive view of the business's performance.

This project is a testament to my expertise in data visualization, data transformation, and data cleaning. From extracting and transforming data using SQL, to crafting complex DAX formulas for in-depth analysis, and finally visualizing the insights with Power BI, every step highlights my skills and dedication to delivering actionable insights.
